/**
 * Base modular game state for this project. This is the primary handler for game initialization, responsible for
 * loading the modular game mode data (via the UGameModeManagerComponent), and executing its startup routines
 * (executing actions, loading assets, etc.).
 *
 * @note In this framework "loading game mode data" refers to loading the game mode data asset into memory. "Loading
 * the game mode" refers to loading the data and features that comprise the current game mode (actions, game features,
 * etc.), as defined in the game mode data asset, as opposed to loading the actual AGameMode actor. In Lyra, they would
 * call the game mode the "Experience," but I want to make sure it's clear that the game mode itself is being defined
 * by the game mode dataâ€”i.e. "experiences" are just modular game modes.
