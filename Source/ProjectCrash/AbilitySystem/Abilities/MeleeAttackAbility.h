/**
 * A standard melee attack. When activated, a collision detector capsule will be drawn ahead of the user's camera to
 * check for any targets for the duration of the ability. This is intended for primary attacks that can be performed
 * repeatedly in succession without a cooldown; it has not been tested for use with one-off abilities.
 *
 * A series of first- and third-person attack animations must be defined to play when the ability is activated. Each
 * animation will be played in a looping order with each subsequent attack, until the attack sequence is reset (i.e.
 * the user stops attacking).
 *
 * By default, hit detection is performed once during an attack, when the Event.Ability.PerformTargeting event is
 * received by the owning ASC. The bUseInstantTargeting property can be disabled to switch to duration-based targeting,
 * which will use a target actor to continuously perform hit detection while the ability is active.
