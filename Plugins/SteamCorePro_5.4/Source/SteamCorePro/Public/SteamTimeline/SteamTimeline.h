// Game phases allow the user to navigate their background recordings and clips. Exactly what a game phase means will vary game to game, but
// the game phase should be a section of gameplay that is usually between 10 minutes and a few hours in length, and should be the
// main way a user would think to divide up the game. These are presented to the user in a UI that shows the date the game was played,
// with one row per game slice. Game phases should be used to mark sections of gameplay that the user might be interested in watching.
//
//	Examples could include:
//		* A single match in a multiplayer PvP game
//		* A chapter of a story-based singleplayer game
//		* A single run in a roguelike
//
// Game phases are started with StartGamePhase, and while a phase is still happening, they can have tags and attributes added to them.
//
// Phase attributes represent generic text fields that can be updated throughout the duration of the phase. They are meant
// to be used for phase metadata that is not part of a well defined set of options. For example, a KDA attribute that starts
// with the value "0/0/0" and updates as the phase progresses, or something like a played-entered character name. Attributes
// can be set as many times as the game likes with SetGamePhaseAttribute, and only the last value will be shown to the user.
//
// Phase tags represent data with a well defined set of options, which could be data such as match resolution, hero played,
// game mode, etc. Tags can have an icon in addition to a text name. Multiple tags within the same group may be added per phase
// and all will be remembered. For example, AddGamePhaseTag may be called multiple times for a "Bosses Defeated" group, with
// different names and icons for each boss defeated during the phase, all of which will be shown to the user.
//
// The phase will continue until the game exits, until the game calls EndGamePhase, or until the game calls
// StartGamePhase to start a new phase.
